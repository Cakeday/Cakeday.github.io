            <p>
                I am an up-and-coming web developer who loves thinking of 
                novel solutions to complex problems. As a perpetual "what-if" asker, 
                I find myself constantly thinking of questions that no one else 
                seems to be asking. Being proficient in multiple programming languages 
                and their respective web frameworks, I have the ability to generate 
                these solutions myself. I am someone who is passionate about working 
                with others, learning on the fly, and spurring innovation. I pick 
                things up incredibly quickly and am myself a warehouse of curiosity; 
                I *will* ask questions. I believe that my growth process as a 
                developer and a creative mind will only continue to skyrocket, 
                and that I will soon be a stellar programmer.
